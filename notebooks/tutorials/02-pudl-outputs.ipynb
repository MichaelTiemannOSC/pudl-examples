    "The PUDL database tables are a clean, [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) version of US electricity data. Normalized tables are great for databases and storage, but for interactive use, we often want a version of the data that includes plant and utility names and other associated info all in a single dataframe. These are \"denormalized\" tables. In addition to the referenced names and attributes like latitude and longitude or state, the denormalized tables often contain frequently calculated derived values (like calcuating `total_fuel_cost` from `total_heat_content_mmbtu` and `fuel_cost_per_mmbtu`). The Catalyst team developed a useful tool to access denormalized tables that we call the PUDL output object."

    " * **Standardized denormalization:** You don't have to manually join the same tables together to get access to common attributes.\n",
    " * **Table caching:** many analyses rely on using the same table multiple times. The PUDL output object caches the tables in memory as pandas dataframes so you don't have to read tables from the database over and over again.\n",
    " * **Time series aggregation:** Some tables are annual, some monthly, some hourly. When you create a PUDL output object you can tell it to aggregate the data to either monthly or annual resolution for analysis.\n",
    " * **Standardized the filling-in of missing data:** There's a ton of missing or incomplete data. If requested, the output objects will use rolling averages and  data from the EIA API try to fill some of that missing data in."
