# PUDL Tutorials

This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks intended to help new users
become familiar with the data that's available through Catalyst Cooperative's
[Public Utility Data Liberation (PUDL) project](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl).

The notebooks are designed to be used on a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub)
that already has all of the PUDL data and software installed, via
[nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/) links.
