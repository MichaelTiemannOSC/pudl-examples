# PUDL Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) with examples of how
to use the data and software distributed
[Catalyst Cooperative](https://catalyst.coop)'s
[Public Utility Data Liberation (PUDL) project](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl).

The examples require the PUDL data to be available, and it is too large to
commit to a GitHub repository. We have an experimental shared
[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) running in
collaboration with [2i2c](https://2i2c.org). If you have an account on our
hub, you can work through the example notebooks by following
[this link](https://catalyst-cooperative.pilot.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcatalyst-cooperative%2Fpudl-tutorials&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fpudl-tutorials%2Fnotebooks%2F01-pudl-database.ipynb&branch=main). If you'd like to get an account

We also use this repository to define PUDL's computational environment for
users, via `[repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker)`.
